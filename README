This will serve as a collection of Perl scripts that run on Android using ASE.

You can install an Android emulator using instructions from the Android
developers website and then install ASE (Android Scripting Environment).

Once you have it, you can install a Perl interpreter.

Hopefully these scripts will show an example of how to develop on Android with
Perl.
